  <h1>Euler's Identity</h1>
  
  <div class="identity">
    Euler's identity is a remarkable mathematical equation that connects five fundamental mathematical constants: <em>e</em>, <em>i</em>, π (pi), 1, and 0. It can be expressed as:
    <br><br>
    <em><b>e<sup>iπ</sup> + 1 = 0</b></em>
    <br><br>
    This equation encapsulates the relationship between exponential functions, imaginary numbers, trigonometric functions, and the concept of zero.

    <strong>Explanation:</strong>
    <br>
    Euler's identity was discovered by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. It is considered one of the most elegant and profound equations in mathematics due to its concise representation of interconnected concepts.
    <br><br>
    The equation consists of several important mathematical constants. <em>e</em> represents Euler's number, a mathematical constant approximately equal to <b>2.71828</b>. <em>i</em> denotes the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1. π (pi) is the mathematical constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
    <br><br>
    Remarkably, when <em>e</em>, <em>i</em>, and π are combined in the exponentiation operation in Euler's identity, the result is equal to -1, with an additional 1 on the other side of the equation. This connection between seemingly unrelated mathematical constants demonstrates the depth and beauty of mathematics.
