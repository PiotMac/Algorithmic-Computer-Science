				<h2>Description: </h2>
				<p>Currently I am a second-year student at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology and I am studying Algorithmic Computer Science.</p>
				<p>I have many passions, both professional and less related to science. My main topics of interest are:</p>
				<h4>Non-computer related:</h4>
				<p><b>Roller skating:</b> I have been learning roller skating for 2-3 years now and it is definitely one of my favourite sports.</p>
				<p><b>Playing guitar:</b> I've got my first guitar 2 years ago and since then I come back to this instrument from time to time.</p>
				<h4>Computer related:</h4>
				<p><b>Mobile applications:</b> This year I started course about creating applications for mobile phones, tablets etc. and I have to admit it really got my interest.</p>
				<p><b>Artificial intelligence:</b> Nowadays AI has become one of the fastest growing fields of science and it is absolutely marvelous to watch this field expand.</p>
