# Description
The program `main.py` is used in terms of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). For the given data (my data is taken from [https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/vlsi/index.html] and it is in **data** directory)
it generates Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and its weight. It also creates a TSP cycle based on this MST using Depth-First-Search and also calculates its weight. The program also performs similar calculations
for randomly chosen permutations of all vertices that create a TSP cycle. For better understanding, the program visualizes all those efforts and creates plots that can be found under **plots** directory.
I have also attached here my report where I go into more details.
# Usage
Simply write `./main.py`.
