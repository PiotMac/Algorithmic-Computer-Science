# Description
Programs in this directory refer to standard Huffman Coding and while encoding (by using **HuffmanEncoding.java**) the proper dictionary is added. It can be then decoded using **HuffmanDecoding.java**.
The Huffman tree is created and it consists of nodes descripted by **HuffmanNode.java**.
# Usage
1. Encoding
  - To encode a file, use `java HuffmanEncoding <input_file> <output_encoded_file>`.
2. Decoding
  - To decode a file, use `java HuffmanDecoding <input_encoded_file> <output_decoded_file>`.
