2. `Noise.java`
- Usage: `java Noise <probability> <inputFile> <outputFile>`
- Description: With a given probability inverts every bit in an input file and saves the result in an output file.
3. `Decoder.java`
- Usage: `java Decoder <encodedFile> <decodedFile>`
- Description: Decodes an encoded (and modified by noise) file into a decoded file. It also prints in how many cases it encountered two errors.
4. `Check.java`
- Usage: `java Check <firstFile> <secondFile>`
- Description: Compares two files and prints how many 4-bit blocks are different from each other.
