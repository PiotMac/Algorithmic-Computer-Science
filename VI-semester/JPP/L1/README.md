# Programming Languages and Paradigms

## Task 1
Create a library interface in the C language (conforming to at least the C99 standard) that contains the following three functions:
1. A function to calculate the value of `n!` (factorial of n).
2. A function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two natural numbers.
3. A function to solve the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = c` with integer solutions.

Ensure appropriate selection of argument types for these functions, and for the third function, ensure the result is an appropriate structure.

Provide two independent implementations for this library: one based on loops and the other on recursion.

Write a program to demonstrate the correctness of the implemented library.

## Task 2
Create a module in the Ada language for the three functions from the previous task, also providing two separate implementations.
Ensure appropriate selection of variable types and loop constructs (decide when to use `for` loops and when to use `while` loops).

Write a program to demonstrate the correctness of the implemented library.

## Task 3
Repeat the above task in another programming language that follows the procedural/modular programming paradigm.

## Task 4
Write a wrapper in the C language for the module written in Ada in Task 2 and a program to test the correctness of the wrapper. Ensure that variable types are compatible between the two languages.

## Task 5
Write a wrapper in the Ada language for the library written in C in Task 1 and a program to test the correctness of the wrapper. Ensure that variable types are compatible between the two languages.

## Task 6
Write a wrapper in the language from Task 3 for the library written in C in Task 1 and a program to test the correctness of the wrapper. Ensure that variable types are compatible between the two languages.

## Task 7
Write a wrapper in the C language for the library written in the language from Task 3 and a program to test the correctness of the wrapper. Ensure that variable types are compatible between the two languages.
